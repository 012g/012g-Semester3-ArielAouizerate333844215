Web Project By Ariel Aouizerate <br />

Created 5 pages using HTML, CSS3 and JS. <br />

// -=-  HTML -=- // <br />
The HTML side is devided into two parts (which each of them has special CSS settings - due styling mode), all page are fully redirecting towards log-in -> join-event / create event -> log out. <br />
// -=- CSS -=- //<br />
On the landing page of login I have added a fading down annimation to improve the design of the web-site.
Also button and tab bar after the log-in (My-Evens/Join Event/Create Event) have a special "loading" bars. <br />
// -=- JS -=- //<br />
I have used 2 JS dynamic function:
  1. Function that helps user to choose which view he preffers - grid or rows.
  2. A validation function for password (matching and lenght) to improve security and user experience.
  3. A Code generator that generates uniq code in order to create "invite code" to group created by users - for now the generator is up and running after linking it to
     database it will ensure uniqness.
